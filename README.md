# GirlScoutCookieSales
This program is to allow users to input as much scouts that sold cookies, and the amount of boxes they sold. It is also supposed to inform the user how many scouts sold cookies in the range.

TODO
Have the code count the number of boxes sold between two digits and display the number of scouts in each group.
